    Battery widget moved to batat.lua in preparation for a new bat widget.
    
    It's time for a standalone battery widget that reads
    /proc/acpi/battery/*/{info,state} alone. However the old battery
    widget that uses 'acpitool' will not be deleted, let it serve as an
    alternative widget as a convenience. Some might also prefer it over
    reading multiple files in /proc

    Weather widget written and included, by request.
    
    The widget uses 'wget' to grab the information. The Lua socket library
    would be nicer, of course, but let's not introduce external libraries
    at this point. Wget will write to stdout with a timeout of 5s. This
    has the potential to block everything else in case of problems... But
    let's not introduce temporary files at this point. Besides having to
    handle files, operations while running on battery power are to be
    avoided.
