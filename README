Description
-----------

Vicious is a modular widget library for "awesome" window manager,
derived from the "Wicked" widget library. It has some of the old
Wicked widget types, a few of them rewritten, and a good number of new
widgets. You can read more about why and how it was written, here:

  http://sysphere.org/~anrxc/j/archives/2009/07/09/vicious_widgets_for_awesome_wm


Usage
-----

To use vicious, copy it to the ~/.config/awesome directory and edit
init.lua to comment out all the widgets you don't need, from the
"Configure widgets" list. Then add:

  require("vicious")

...to the top of your rc.lua. Once you create a widget (as a:
textbox, graph or a progressbar) call vicious.register() to register
it with vicious:

  vicious.register(widget, type, format, interval, field, argument or padding)

widget   - widget created with widget()
type     - one of the available widget types (see below for a list)
format   - a string argument or a function
         - string: $1, $2, $3... will be replaced by their respective value
           returned from the widget type, some widget types return
	   tables with keys, in that case use: ${key}
         - function: function(widget, args) can be used to manipulate
           data returned by the widget type, more below
interval - number of seconds between updates of the widget
field    - used to feed graphs or progressbars, by their name
padding  - minimum amount of numbers the widget will output, if
           available for that widget type
argument - some widgets require an argument to be passed, like the
           battery ID


Other Functions
---------------

Unregister
  vicious.unregister(widget, keep)

  keep   - if true the widget will be suspended, waiting to be activated

Suspend  - suspend all widgets, used when running on battery power
  vicious.suspend()

Activate - restart all suspended, or unregistered but kept, widgets
  vicious.activate(widget)

  widget - if provided, only that widget will be activated

Regregister 
  vicious.regregister(reg)

  - vicious.register() and vicious.unregister() both return a reg object, this
    contains information about the widget and the updates that should be sent to
    it, you can pass this reg object into regregister after unregistering it, and
    it will be reregistered (or activated if it was only suspended).

Caching
  vicious.enable_caching(type)

  - by default caching is enabled for all widget types, with caching
    you can have multiple widgets using the same (widget type)function
    and it gets executed only once


Widget types
------------

Widget types consist of worker functions that take the "format"
argument given to vicious.register as the first argument, "padding" or
"argument" the as the second, and return a table of values to insert
in the format string.

vicious.widgets.cpu
  - provides CPU usage for all available CPUs/cores

vicious.widgets.thermal
  - provides temperature levels of ACPI thermal zones
  - takes the thermal zone as an argument, i.e. "TZS0"

vicious.widgets.load
  - provides system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes

vicious.widgets.uptime
  - provides system uptime information

vicious.widgets.bat
  - provides state, charge, and remaining time for a requested battery
  - takes battery ID as an argument, i.e. "BAT0"

vicious.widgets.batat
  - provides state, charge, and remaining time for all batteries using
    acpitool

vicious.widgets.mem
  - provides RAM and Swap usage statistics

vicious.widgets.fs
  - provides usage statistics for requested mount points

vicious.widgets.dio
  - provides I/O statistics for requested storage devices
  - takes the disk as an argument, i.e. "/dev/hda"

vicious.widgets.net
  - provides usage statistics for all network interfaces

vicious.widgets.wifi
  - provides wireless information for a requested interface
  - takes the network interface as an argument, i.e. "wlan0"

vicious.widgets.mbox
  - provides the subject of last e-mail in a mbox file
  - takes the full path to the mbox as an argument

vicious.widgets.mdir
  - provides a number of new and unread messages in a Maildir
    structure
  - takes the full path to the Maildir structure as an argument

vicious.widgets.entropy
  - provides available system entropy

vicious.widgets.org
  - provides agenda statistics for Emacs org-mode
  - takes a table with full paths to agenda files, that will be
    included, as an argument

vicious.widgets.pacman
  - provides number of pending updates on Arch Linux

vicious.widgets.mpd
  - provides the currently playing song in MPD

vicious.widgets.volume
  - provides volume levels of requested ALSA mixers
  - takes the ALSA channel as an argument, i.e. "Master"

vicious.widgets.weather
  - provides weather information for a requested station
  - takes the weather station ID as an argument, i.e. "LDRI"

vicious.widgets.date
  - provides access to os.date, with optional custom formatting;
    provided as the format string


Custom widget types
-------------------

Use any of the existing widgets as a starting point for your own. I
created vicious so we can focus on the number crunching and nothing
else. You write a quick worker function that does the work and plug it
in. How the data will be formatted, will it be red or blue, should be
defined in rc.lua.


Format functions
----------------

You can use a function instead of a string as the format parameter, so
you are able to check the value returned by the widget type and change
it. You can change the color of a widget, i.e. on low battery, or hide
widgets when they return a certain value or...

The format function will get the widget as its first argument, and a
table with the values otherwise inserted into the format string as its
second argument, and should return the text to be used for the widget.

Example widget
  mpdwidget = widget({ type = 'textbox',name = 'mpdwidget'})
  vicious.register(mpdwidget,vicious.widgets.mpd, 
    function (widget, args)
      if args[1] == "Stopped" then
        return ''
      else
        return ' <span color="white">MPD:</span> '..args[1]
      end
  end)

  - hides the mpd widget when there is no song playing


Usage examples
--------------

Remember, besides creating and registering widgets you have to add them
to a statusbar in order to display them.

MPD widget
  mpdwidget = widget({type = 'textbox',name = 'mpdwidget')
  vicious.register(mpdwidget,vicious.widgets.mpd,'$1',30)

  - executed every 30 seconds, takes no arguments

Memory widget
  memwidget = widget({type = 'textbox',name = 'memwidget'})
  vicious.register(memwidget,vicious.widgets.mem,'$1 ($2MB/$3MB)',1,nil,{2, 4, 4})

  - executed every second, appends "MB" to 2nd and 3rd argument, uses
    padding

File system widget
  fswidget = widget({type = 'progressbar',name = 'fswidget'})
  -- configure the progressbar and bar properties, then register with:
  vicious.register(fswidget,vicious.widgets.fs,'${/home usep}',120,fswidget)

  - executed every 120 seconds, requests the value of the ${home usep}
    key and feeds the "fswidget" progressbar

Battery widget
  batwidget = widget({type = 'progressbar',name = 'batwidget'})
  -- configure the progressbar and bar properties, then register with:
  vicious.register(batwidget,vicious.widgets.bat,'$2',60,batwidget,'BAT0')

  - executed every 60 seconds, feeds the "batwidget" progressbar,
    provides "BAT0" battery ID as an argument

Mbox widget
  mboxwidget = widget({type = 'textbox',name = 'mboxwidget'})
  vicious.register(mboxwidget,vicious.widgets.mbox,'$1',240,nil,'/home/user/mail/Inbox')

  - executed every 240 seconds, provides full path to the mbox as an
    argument


All other widgets are used in the same manner. You can check the
